# LAUTECH-SKill-Acquisition-Program

LAUTECH ICT Centre in conjunction with the LAUTECH Centre for Research Innovation Discovery organized a free Online Skill Acquisition programme for students as an improvement plan during the global pandemic period. I volunteered to mentor students across various departments and levels in Python Programming Language and Data Science Basics. The 7-Day e-training was held on zoom from Thursday April 9 to Friday April 17, 2020.

The training outline is as follows:

- Day1: Introduction
  - Brief Introduction: Aim of the training and Deliverables

  - While loops

- Day2: Other data type/structure - Lists, Ranges & Tuples
  - Flow control (contd)
  - Lists in Python
  - Ranges
  - List Comprehension
  - Tuples

- Day3: Other data structure (contd)m modular programming
  - Python Dictionaries and Sets
  - Functions in Python â€“ Defining a function, passing arguments, return values, passing a list,
passing an arbitrary number of arguments, storing your functions in Modules, styling functions.
  - Time and DateTime in Python, Lambda Expressions

NB: At this point, OOP, Generators etc are other essential concepts for participants inteested in Python for Application Development Operations (DevOps)

- Day4: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning 
  - Modules and standard Python library
  - Data Science tools - Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodel, Matplotlib,Seaborn etc

Day 5: Numpy, Pandas
